- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bongewj
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data to drive decisions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use Python for data science and machine learning. This page chronicles my data science journey.

# Contents

- **Data Analysis and Visualisation**
  - [Examining Effects of Wear on Body Armour](https://github.com/bongewj/BallisticTests/blob/main/BodyArmourWear.ipynb): The effects of wear and tear and wet/dry conditions on body armour performance against .22 and .38 cal rounds were examined. Data published by the NIJ and NRC was used. 
  - [Most Popular Bubble Tea Shops in Each Town](https://github.com/bongewj/BubbleTea/blob/main/BubbleTea.py): The most popular bubble tea franchises in each town were extracted and indicated on a map of Singapore. Data published by the Singapore Department of Statistics and information extracted using the Foursquare API were used.
  - [Evolution of SG Ministries' Budgets](https://github.com/bongewj/SGBudget/blob/main/SG%20Budget.py): The evolution of expenditures of each ministry over time was examined and plotted in an animation. Data extracted from Data.gov.sg was used.

    _Tools: Pandas, Scipy, scikit-learn, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Geopy Nominatim, Folium_
 
- **Machine Learning**
  - [Identifying Business Opportunities in Tampines](https://github.com/bongewj/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Capstone%20Final%20Report_v2.ipynb): Recommendations on potentially underserved business categories were identified using data published by the Singapore Department of Statistics and information extracted using the Foursquare API.

    _Tools: Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Geopy Nominatim, Folium_
    
- **Natural Language Processing**

- **Optimisation**
  - [Finding Optimal Parameters for Autodyn Simulation](https://github.com/bongewj/ParameterOptimisation/blob/main/Parameter%20Optimisation.py): Curve fittings were attempted to results from a parameter sweep of Autodyn settings. Optimisations of fitted curves were performed to obtain optimal parameters to maxiimise accuracy of simulations. The set of parameters used for the "experiments" that generated the results was obtained using [experiment design tools](https://nps.edu/web/seed/software-downloads) available from the Naval Postgraduate School's SEED Center for Data Farming.
